Question 7:

In order for Structured Streaming to reliably track the exact progress of the processing so that it can handle any kind of failure by restarting and/or reprocessing,
which of the following two approaches is used by Spark to record the offset range of the data being processed in each trigger?

Options:
A. ✅ Checkpointing and Write-ahead Logs (✅ Correct Answer)
B. Structured Streaming cannot record the offset range of the data being processed in each trigger.
C. Replayable Sources and Idempotent Sinks
D. Write-ahead Logs and Idempotent Sinks
E. Checkpointing and Idempotent Sinks

✅ Final Answer:
A. Checkpointing and Write-ahead Logs

These two mechanisms ensure exactly-once semantics and help Spark recover progress when a failure occurs during stream processing.
